# Captchalogue-C-Sharp
### A C# program meant to simulate a captchalogue card from the webcomic Homestuck.

So, I've finally started rebuilding the Captcha Card Sim in C#. 
There isn't much to it at the moment, but I hope to constantly update it to the level that the Java version is right now.
In fact, my plan is to add more features to it than are in the final version of the original.

I've learned the basics of using Git, which means development on this will be a lot more organized.
I'll eventually add documentation, but in the meantime I'm focused on the programming itself.
